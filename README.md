# Feedbacks

This repository is to keep track of the Feedbacks I'm sending Apple with sample projects ready to check against new versions.

I don't have history of every feedback I did in the past, so before September 2023 is gone forever 🥲

| Feedback   | Impact | Status | Description |
| ---------- | ------ | -------- | ----------- |
